    "*Snail Labyrinth* est un jeu dont le but est de guider des escargots dans un labyrinthe jusqu'à leur sortie personnelle. La taille des labyrinthes varie. Chaque escargot peut se déplacer dans cinq directions: vers le haut, vers le bas, vers la droite, vers la gauche et rester sur place. \n",
    "\n",

    "Les escargots ne peuvent pas se déplacer dans une case où se déplace un autre escargot. De plus, les escargots laissent derrière ils une substance toxique et ne peuvent donc pas se déplacer dans une case qui a déjà été occupée par un autre escargot.\n",

    "\n",
    "Il est maintenant possible de chercher une solution avec notre implémentation actuelle. Il y a deux idées principales: \n",
    "\n",
    "1. Nous cherchons la solution la plus rapide, il nous faut énumérer tous les états pour les ordonner en ordre croissant en terme de nombre de mouvements. On va donc utiliser une file de type FIFO. \n",
    "2. Il est nécessaire de mémoriser les états que l'on a déjà trouvé. Pour cela on va utiliser un ensemble hash. Il s'agit d'utiliser une variable locale **to_visit** de type *set*.\n",
    "\n",
    "On peut représenter un ensemble d'état par un arbre dont la racine est l'état initial et les nœuds correspondent aux états `s`. La relation entre chaque état est de type `s` *est fils de* `p`, où `s` et `p` sont deux états. Autrement dit, `s` peut être obtenu à partir de `p` en un mouvement.\n",

    "On cherche à faire une recherche en largeur sur cet arbre. On peut donc représenter la file par une liste (FIFO). La file commence avec l'état initial.

    "\n",
    "La méthode proposée précédemment utilise une recherche en largeur pour trouver la solution. Une solution plus rapide peut être mise en place avec un algorithme `A*`. L'idée principale de l'algorithme A* est d'insérer de *l'intelligence artificielle* à la méthode de résolution. Ceci est fait en utilisant une fonction d'estimation qui permet d'évaluer la distance entre un état et la solution. \n",
    "\n",
    "Au lieu d'utiliser une approche *first-in first-out (premier entré, premier sorti)* lors de la visite des états, l'algorithme A* défini une valeur de priorité pour chaque état, à partir de la fonction d'estimation, et commence par visiter les états les plus prioritaires. Pour cela, on utilise une structure de données bien plus appropriée : une file de priorité.\n",
    "\n",
    "En plus de la fonction d'estimation, A* doit aussi tenir compte d'une autre information importante : le coût actuel de l'état. Ce coût est tout simplement, dans notre cas, la distance entre l'état actuel et l'état initial. Ces deux éléments mis ensembles permettent de calculer la fonction d'estimation heuristique ***f*** d'un état `s`, comme la somme du coût actuel de l'état ***c*** et de l'estimation du coût restant ***h***. \n",

    "**Mise en place de l'algorithme**\n",
    "\n",
    "- Il nous faut donc calculer le nombre de mouvements nécessaires pour atteindre l'état actuel, `coût(s)`. Pour le calculer, créez une variable `nb_moves` dans la classe `State` qui enregistre le nombre de mouvements effectués pour arriver à cet état. Cette variable commence à 0 et doit être incrémentée à chaque fois que l'on crée un nouvel état en utilisant la fonction `move(d)`.\n",
    "\n",
    "Le coût de la fonction d'estimation est représenté par la variable `h`. Cette fonction estime le nombre de coups restants. Cette composante joue un rôle important dans l'efficacité de l'algorithme A*. Cette variable est utilisée dans la fonction `__lt__` de la classe *State*, qui compare la fonction d'estimation ` f` de deux états. \n",
    "\n",
    "Il est donc important de créer une bonne fonction pour résoudre le problème. Plus cette fonction est efficace, moins d'états inutiles seront visités. Cette fonction doit par contre toujours renvoyer un minorant du nombre de coups restant. On va analyser deux fonctions différentes dans ce TP.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Fonction 1: à partir de la distance entre les escargots et leur sortie.\n",
    "- Complétez dans la classe State, la fonction ``estimee1()`` qui renvoie la distance plus grande entre les escargots et leur sortie.\n",
    "- Maintenant complétez la méthode `solve_Astar(state)` pour résoudre le problème de la même façon qu'au début du TP, mais en utilisant la file de priorité à la place d'une file ordinaire.\n",
    "- Modifiez les fonctions `solve_Astar(state)` et `solve(state)` de façon à compter et afficher le nombre d'états visités lors de la résolution.\n",
    "- Modifiez le code des fonctions `solve7(),solve9(),solve12()` pour résoudre les problèmes à l'aide de l'algorithme A*. Vérifiez que les solutions sont obtenues en autant de mouvements qu'avec le premier algorithme, mais avec un nombre inférieur d'états visités. \n",
