La taille des labyrinthes varie. Chaque escargot peut se déplacer dans cinq directions: vers le haut, vers le bas, vers la droite, vers la gauche et rester sur place. \n\nA chaque étape, chaque escargot à la possibilité d'effectuer un mouvement.\nLes escargots ne peuvent pas se déplacer dans une case où se déplace un autre escargot. De plus, les escargots laissent derrière ils une substance toxique et ne peuvent donc pas se déplacer dans une case qui a déjà été occupée par un autre escargot.\n\nA titre d'illustation, les images ci-dessous donnent un exemple d'une configuration initiale (Figure 1) et d'une configuration où deux mouvements ont eté realisés (Figure 2). Les étapes sont les suivantes:\n\n- Etape 1: le escargot A se déplace vers la droite et le escargot B vers la droite.\n- Etape 2: le escargot A se déplace vers la droite et le escargot B vers la droite.\n\n<table><tr>\n<td> <img src=\"https://imgur.com/3W4iDSk.png\" alt=\"Drawing\"/> <figcaption>Figure 1 - Example d'une configuration initiale.</figcaption></td>\n<td> <img src=\"https://imgur.com/3uaD3AO.png\" alt=\"Drawing\"/><figcaption>Figure 2 - Example de deux mouvements.</figcaption> </td>\n</tr></table>\n\nL'objectif de ce TP est d'écrire un programme qui permet aux escargots d'atteindre leur destination en un **minimum de mouvements**.\n\nPour ce faire, il vous est demandé de compléter les deux classes fournies en Python. Vous pouvez réimplémenter ces classes-là et faire le TP dans un autre langage si vous le désirez.\n\n## 1. Représentation du problème (10pts)\n\nLe problème est défini par les règles suivantes. Les colonnes sont numérotées de gauche à droite de 0 à $m$ et les lignes sont numérotées de haut en bas, de 0 à $n$. Un escargot est considérée *résolue* lorsqu'il arrive à sa propre sortie.\n\nL'état du labyrinthe est représenté par un objet de la classe **State** qui contient les variables d'instance suivantes: \n\n- `pos`: vecteur indiquant la position de chaque escargot sur la grille;\n- `venoms`: ensemble des positions du poison laissé par les escargots;\n- `d`: liste indiquant la direction du déplacement de chaque escargot fait à partir de l'état précédent pour atteindre l'état courant (0: rester en place, 1: vers le haut, 2: vers la droite, 3: vers le bas et 4: vers la gauche);\n- `prev`: l'état précédent\n\n","metadata":{"colab_type":"text","id":"mhw_Vw1_KBIP"}},{"cell_type":"code","source":"import numpy as np\nimport math\nimport copy\n\nclass Position:\n    def __init__(self, x, y):\n        self.x = x\n        self.y = y\n\n    def distance(self, other):\n        return math.fabs(other.x - self.x) + math.fabs(other.y - self.y)\n        \n    def __eq__(self, other):\n        return self.x == other.x and self.y == other.y\n    \n    def __repr__(self):\n        return \"(%d,%d)\" % (self.x, self.y)\n    \n    def __str__(self):\n        return \"(%d,%d)\" % (self.x, self.y)\n    \n    def __hash__(self):\n        return int(self.x*1+self.y*2)\n\nclass State:\n    \n    \"\"\"\n    Contructeur d'un état initial\n    \"\"\"\n    def __init__(self, pos):\n        \"\"\"\n        pos donne la position du escargot i;\n        \"\"\"\n        self.pos = np.array(copy.deepcopy(pos))\n        \"\"\"\n        venoms garde les positions du poisons\n        \"\"\"\n        self.venoms = set()\n        \n        \"\"\"\n        d et prev premettent de retracer l'état précédent et le dernier mouvement effectué\n        \"\"\"\n        self.d = self.prev = None\n        \n        self.nb_moves = 0\n        self.h = 0\n\n    \"\"\"\n    Constructeur d'un état à partir mouvement (d)\n    \"\"\"\n    def move(self, d):\n        # TODO\n        s = State(self.pos)\n        s.d = d\n        s.venoms = set(self.venoms)\n        s.prev = self\n        for i in range (len(d)):\n            if (d[i]==1):\n                s.venoms.add(self.pos[i])\n                s.pos[i].x-=1\n            elif (d[i]==2):\n                s.venoms.add(self.pos[i])\n                s.pos[i].y+=1\n            elif (d[i]==3):\n                s.venoms.add(self.pos[i])\n                s.pos[i].x+=1\n            elif (d[i]==4):\n                s.venoms.add(self.pos[i])\n                s.pos[i].y-=1\n        s.nb_moves += 1\n                    \n        return s\n    \n    def __eq__(self, other):\n        if not isinstance(other, State):\n            return NotImplemented\n        if len(self.pos) != len(other.pos):\n            print(\"les états n'ont pas le même nombre de limaces\")\n\n        return (len(self.venoms) == len(other.venoms) and np.array_equal(self.pos, other.pos) and self.venoms == other.venoms)\n        \n    def __hash__(self):\n        h = 0\n        for snail_position in self.pos:\n            h += snail_position.x*25 + snail_position.y*30\n        for venom_position in self.venoms:\n            h += snail_position.x*25 + snail_position.y*30\n        return int(h)\n    \n    def __lt__(self, other):\n        return (self.nb_moves + self.h) < (other.nb_moves + other.h)\n\n    def __repr__(self):\n        out = \"\"\n        for index, limace in enumerate(self.pos):\n            out += \"Escargot %d (%d,%d) | \" % (index+1, limace.x, limace.y)\n        return \"State: \" + out[:-3]\n    \n    def __str__(self):\n        out = \"\"\n        for index, limace in enumerate(self.pos):\n            out += \"Escargot %d (%d,%d) | \" % (index+1, limace.x, limace.y)\n        return out[:-3]\n        ","metadata":{"colab":{},"colab_type":"code","id":"sJoIQLWMqxlI","trusted":true},"execution_count":2,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"#### Implémentation \n   - Complétez la fonction ***move*** en déplaçant les escargots de 1 case dans la bonne direction (d[i]= 0, 1, 2, 3 ou 4).

À la recherche d'une solution (30pts)\n\nIl est maintenant possible de chercher une solution avec notre implémentation actuelle. Il y a deux idées principales: \n\n1. Nous cherchons la solution la plus rapide, il nous faut énumérer tous les états pour les ordonner en ordre croissant en terme de nombre de mouvements. On va donc utiliser une file de type FIFO. \n2. Il est nécessaire de mémoriser les états que l'on a déjà trouvé. Pour cela on va utiliser un ensemble hash. Il s'agit d'utiliser une variable locale **to_visit** de type *set*.\n\nOn peut représenter un ensemble d'état par un arbre dont la racine est l'état initial et les nœuds correspondent aux états `s`. La relation entre chaque état est de type `s` *est fils de* `p`, où `s` et `p` sont deux états. Autrement dit, `s` peut être obtenu à partir de `p` en un mouvement.\n\nOn cherche à faire une recherche en largeur sur cet arbre. On peut donc représenter la file par une liste (FIFO). La file commence avec l'état initial. Tant que la liste n'est pas vide, on extrait le premier état. Si l'état est final, on termine l'exécution de l'algorithme. Dans le cas contraire, on ajoute ses fils non visités à la fin de la liste. On ajoute ensuite cet état dans la liste `to_visit`.\n\n#### Implementation \n   - Complétez la méthode **solve** en implémentant cet algorithme. La méthode doit renvoyer un état final (las limaces doivent être à leur sortie). \n   - Complétez la méthode **print_solution(state)** qui affiche une solution à partir d'un état final `state`. Il faut afficher les mouvements des escargots dans le bon ordre.\n\nUtilisez la cellule suivante pour tester votre code. Vous devriez obtenir le résultat suivant:  \nIl y a 7 mouvements à faire pour résoudre le problème de la figure de départ. **Note** Votre solution peut être différente de celle présentée ici, cela dépend de la méthode de construction de la liste dans la méthode ``possible_moves``. Cependant votre solution doit avoir le même nombre de mouvements (7).\n\n![example7](https://imgur.com/6nXn3mp.png)\n\n```\n1.

A* algorithme (35pts)\n\nLa méthode proposée précédemment utilise une recherche en largeur pour trouver la solution. Une solution plus rapide peut être mise en place avec un algorithme `A*`. L'idée principale de l'algorithme A* est d'insérer de *l'intelligence artificielle* à la méthode de résolution. Ceci est fait en utilisant une fonction d'estimation qui permet d'évaluer la distance entre un état et la solution. \n\nAu lieu d'utiliser une approche *first-in first-out (premier entré, premier sorti)* lors de la visite des états, l'algorithme A* défini une valeur de priorité pour chaque état, à partir de la fonction d'estimation, et commence par visiter les états les plus prioritaires. Pour cela, on utilise une structure de données bien plus appropriée : une file de priorité.\n\nEn plus de la fonction d'estimation, A* doit aussi tenir compte d'une autre information importante : le coût actuel de l'état. Ce coût est tout simplement, dans notre cas, la distance entre l'état actuel et l'état initial. Ces deux éléments mis ensembles permettent de calculer la fonction d'estimation heuristique ***f*** d'un état `s`, comme la somme du coût actuel de l'état ***c*** et de l'estimation du coût restant ***h***. \n\n<center> f(s) = coût(s) + h(s) </center>\n\n**Mise en place de l'algorithme**\n\n- Il nous faut donc calculer le nombre de mouvements nécessaires pour atteindre l'état actuel, `coût(s)`. Pour le calculer, créez une variable `nb_moves` dans la classe `State` qui enregistre le nombre de mouvements effectués pour arriver à cet état. Cette variable commence à 0 et doit être incrémentée à chaque fois que l'on crée un nouvel état en utilisant la fonction `move(d)`.\n\nLe coût de la fonction d'estimation est représenté par la variable `h`. Cette fonction estime le nombre de coups restants. Cette composante joue un rôle important dans l'efficacité de l'algorithme A*. Cette variable est utilisée dans la fonction `__lt__` de la classe *State*, qui compare la fonction d'estimation ` f` de deux états. \n\nIl est donc important de créer une bonne fonction pour résoudre le problème. Plus cette fonction est efficace, moins d'états inutiles seront visités. Cette fonction doit par contre toujours renvoyer un minorant du nombre de coups restant. On va analyser deux fonctions différentes dans ce TP.\n\n#### Fonction 1: à partir de la distance entre les escargots et leur sortie.\n- Complétez dans la classe State, la fonction ``estimee1()`` qui renvoie la distance plus grande entre les escargots et leur sortie.\n- Maintenant complétez la méthode `solve_Astar(state)` pour résoudre le problème de la même façon qu'au début du TP, mais en utilisant la file de priorité à la place d'une file ordinaire.\n- Modifiez les fonctions `solve_Astar(state)` et `solve(state)` de façon à compter et afficher le nombre d'états visités lors de la résolution.\n- Modifiez le code des fonctions `solve7(),solve9(),solve12()` pour résoudre les problèmes à l'aide de l'algorithme A*. Vérifiez que les solutions sont obtenues en autant de mouvements qu'avec le premier algorithme, mais avec un nombre inférieur d'états visités. \n\nN.B: Vous pouvez ajouter des cellules pour faire le test ou afficher les resultats des algorithmes dans une même cellule.
